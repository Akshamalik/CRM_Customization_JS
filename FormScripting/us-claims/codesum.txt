*Function Purpose-
The function prevents a Lead/Case from being assigned to the MVA01 Program if the attorney’s law firm either:
1.Is not part of the MVA01 program, or
2.Has exceeded their allowed exposure limit (Tier 1 or Tier 2 exposure cap)

The function returns a flag (alreadyBlockedFlag) indicating whether the record should be blocked.
*When The Function Runs-
It runs when a user selects an existing attorney on the form.
If the form is already Inactive or Canceled, it exits immediately (no validation required).
*Step-by-Step Logic
1.Get the selected Attorney
2.Reads the lookup value drb_existingattorney → extracts the attorney Contact ID.
3.Retrieve Program Type Configuration
4.From usc_programtypes Gets three key max exposure limits:usc_partyexposuremax,usc_tier1max,usc_tier2max
4.Retrieve Tier 1 and Tier 2 Law Firm lists
5.Expands many-to-many relationships:usc_programtype_Tier1Account,usc_programtype_Tier2Account,
6.Builds two arrays:
tier1Accounts = [Account IDs]
tier2Accounts = [Account IDs]
7.Get the Attorney’s Law Firm
8.Looks up the attorney’s parentcustomerid (the law firm Account ID).
9.Determine Exposure Limit for That Law Firm
10.If the firm appears in Tier 1 list → use tier1max
or If the firm appears in Tier 2 list → use tier2max
Otherwise → the law firm is not part of the MVA01 program
11.Check Law Firm’s Current Exposure
Retrieves the firm’s current MVA01 exposure: usc_mva01exposure
If exposure exceeds the tier limit:
Show alert
Clear the selected Program Type field
Mark record as blocked
If Not Blocked Yet → Check Program Membership
Runs a FetchXML query to verify if:
The attorney belongs to a law firm
That firm is listed under MVA01 program
If no match found:
Show "Law Firm Blocker" alert
Clear program type
Mark record as blocked
Return Value
return alreadyBlockedFlag;
true → Program selection is blocked
false → Program selection is allowed
